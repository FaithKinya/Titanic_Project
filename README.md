# Titanic Survival Prediction
This project predicts  survival on the Titanic using machine learning, and also test the model perfomance by various Algorithms such as RandomForest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression etc. I came up with metrics for each algorrithm.

# Steps Involved
- Data Exploration & Analysis
- Data preprocessing
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation
- Model Tuning & Optimization

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for Data Visualization
- Scikit-learn for Machine Learning Algorithm
