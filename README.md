# Titanic Survival Prediction
This project predicts  survival on the Titanic using machine learning, and also test the model perfomance by various Algorithms such as RandomForest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression etc.

# Steps Involved
- Data Exploration & Analysis
- Data preprocessing
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation
- Model Tuning & Optimization

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for Data Visualization
- Scikit-learn for Machine Learning Algorithms

# Results for Model Performance
Precision for Class 0 (Survived =0) = 0.78: This means that out of all the passengers the model predicted as not surviving (class 0), 78% were correctly identified as not surviving.
Precision for Class 1 (Survived = 1) = 0.68: This means that out of all the passengers the model predicted as surviving (class 1), 68% were correctly identified as actually surviving.
Recall for Class 0 (Survived = 0) = 0.82: This means that the model was able to correctly identify 82% of all the passengers who actually did not survive.
Recall for Class 1 (Survived = 1) = 0.62: This means that the model was able to correctly identify 62% of all the passengers who actually survived.
